\section{The DUNE 35t LAr Prototype}

The DUNE far detector (see section \ref{sec:DUNEFD}) has a very large, complicated design including many features which are novel to this experiment. In order to optimise and minimise potential complications during construction and commissioning, several levels of prototyping are necessary during the design. These include the membrane cryostat, a TPC within such a cryostat, full scale detector elements, installation test and complete vertical slice tests of all electronics. Many of these have been tested with the first of two DUNE prototypes, the 35-ton (ref Far Detector External Review, May 19-20 2015).
