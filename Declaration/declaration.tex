{\color{red}Happy to remove this paragraph if you want -- since I've mixed up previous work with my contributions (particularly in reconstruction) I thought it may be good to explicitly point out.} The author contributed directly to the success of the 35~ton experiment (Chapter~\ref{chap:35ton}) and developed the reconstruction described in Sections~\ref{sec:Calorimetry} and~\ref{sec:ShowerReconstruction} within Chapter~\ref{chap:LArTPCReconstruction}.  The content presented in Chapters~\ref{chap:OnlineMonitoring},~\ref{chap:35tonAnalysis} and~\ref{chap:FDAnalysis} is all original work.
