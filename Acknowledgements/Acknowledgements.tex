\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

There are just so many people to whom I am in graditude for making the last four years the most fun and rewarding of my life.  I will endeavour to thank as many as possible here!

First, thanks to my supervisor Prof. Lee Thompson for being the greatest advisor I could have wished for.  Always happy to chat, even throughout those 18 months in which we were separated by six time zones, and always affording the best combination of advice and space to develop (needs rewording, but you get the idea!).

People to acknowledge (to be rewritten at a later point)!

Lee, the best.
Michelle, Tom, Tingjun, Alan.
Sheffield physicists -- PhD year, office
Fermilab folk (e.g. Rob, Tristan, Luke, Alex)
Fermilab community (e.g. village, soccer, FSPA)
