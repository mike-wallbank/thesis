abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied in the computer vision community to solve complex problems in image recognition and analysis. We describe an application of the CNN technology to the problem of identifying particle interactions in sampling calorimeters used commonly in high energy physics and high energy neutrino physics in particular. Following a discussion of the core concepts of CNNs and recent innovations in CNN architectures related to the field of deep learning, we outline a specific application to the NOvA neutrino detector. This algorithm, CVN (Convolutional Visual Network) identifies neutrino interactions based on their topology without the need for detailed reconstruction and outperforms algorithms currently in use by the NOvA collaboration.},

abstract = {After the completion of the gallium solar neutrino experiments at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Gallex: 1991–1997; GNO: 1998–2003) we have retrospectively updated the Gallex results with the help of new technical data that were impossible to acquire for principle reasons before the completion of the low rate measurement phase (that is, before the end of the \{GNO\} solar runs). Subsequent high rate experiments have allowed the calibration of absolute internal counter efficiencies and of an advanced pulse shape analysis for counter background discrimination. The updated overall result for Gallex (only) is 73.4 − 7.3 + 7.1 \{SNU\} . This is 5.3% below the old value of 77.5 − 7.8 + 7.5 \{SNU\} (Gallex Collaboration, W. Hampel et al., 1999 [1]), with a substantially reduced error. A similar reduction is obtained from the reanalysis of the 51Cr neutrino source experiments of 1994/1995.},

@article{Capozzi2013,
abstract = {{The standard three-neutrino (3nu) oscillation framework is being increasingly refined by results coming from different sets of experiments, using neutrinos from solar, atmospheric, accelerator and reactor sources. At present, each of the known oscillation parameters [the two squared mass gaps (delta m^2, Delta m^2) and the three mixing angles (theta_12}, theta_13, theta_23)] is dominantly determined by a single class of experiments. Conversely, the unknown parameters [the mass hierarchy, the theta_23 octant and the CP-violating phase delta] can be currently constrained only through a combined analysis of various (eventually all) classes of experiments. In the light of recent new results coming from reactor and accelerator experiments, and of their interplay with solar and atmospheric data, we update the estimated N-sigma ranges of the known 3nu parameters, and revisit the status of the unknown ones. Concerning the hierarchy, no significant difference emerges between normal and inverted mass ordering. A slight overall preference is found for theta_23 in the first octant and for nonzero CP violation with sin delta < 0; however, for both parameters, such preference exceeds 1 sigma only for normal hierarchy. We also discuss the correlations and stability of the oscillation parameters within different combinations of data sets.},

@article{T2KCollaboration2014,
abstract = {New data from the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment produce the most precise measurement of the neutrino mixing parameter theta_{23}. Using an off-axis neutrino beam with a peak energy of 0.6 GeV and a data set corresponding to 6.57 x 10^{20} protons on target, T2K has fit the energy-dependent nu_mu oscillation probability to determine oscillation parameters. Marginalizing over the values of other oscillation parameters yields sin^2 (theta_{23}) = 0.514 +0.055/-0.056 (0.511 +- 0.055), assuming normal (inverted) mass hierarchy. The best-fit mass-squared splitting for normal hierarchy is Delta m^2_{32} = (2.51 +- 0.10) x 10^{-3} eV^2/c^4 (inverted hierarchy: Delta m^2_{13} = (2.48 +- 0.10) x 10^{-3} eV^2/c^4). Adding a model of multinucleon interactions that affect neutrino energy reconstruction is found to produce only small biases in neutrino oscillation parameter extraction at current levels of statistical uncertainty.},

Two sites, Fr{\'{e}}jus (in France at 130km) and Pyh{\"{a}}salmi (in Finland at 2300km), are being considered. Three different detector technologies are being studied: Water Cherenkov, Liquid Scintillator and Liquid Argon. Recently the LAGUNA-LBNO consortium has submitted an Expression of Interest for a very long baseline neutrino experiment, selecting as a first priority the option of a Liquid Argon detector at Pyh{\"{a}}salmi. Detailed potential studies have been curried out for the determination of the neutrino Mass Hierarchy and the discovery of the CP-violation, using a conventional neutrino beam from the CERN SPS with a power of 750kW.},

abstract = {We present `Before and After' global oscillation solutions, as well as predicted `Before and After' values and ranges for ten future solar neutrino observables (for BOREXINO, KamLAND, SNO, and a generic p - p neutrino detector). The `Before' case includes all solar neutrino data (and some theoretical improvements) available prior to April 20, 2002 and the `After' case includes, in addition, the new SNO data on the CC, NC, and day-night asymmetry. We have performed global analyses using the full SNO day-night energy spectrum and, alternatively, using just the SNO NC and CC rates and the day-night asymmetry. The LMA solution is the only currently allowed MSW oscillation solution at $\sim$ 99% CL. The LOW solution is allowed only at more than 2.5$\sigma$, SMA is now excluded at 3.7$\sigma$ or 4.7$\sigma$ depending upon analysis strategy, and pure sterile oscillations are excluded at more than 4.7$\sigma$. Small mixing angles are `out' (pure sterile is `way out'); MSW with large mixing angles is definitely `in'. Vacuum oscillations are allowed at 3$\sigma$, but not at 2$\sigma$. Precise maximal mixing is excluded at 3.2$\sigma$ for MSW solutions and at more than 2.8$\sigma$ for vacuum solutions. Most of the predicted values for future observables for the BOREXINO, KamLAND, and future SNO measurements are changed only by minor amounts by the inclusion of the recent SNO data. In order to test the robustness of the allowed neutrino oscillation regions that are inferred from the measurements and the predicted values for future solar neutrino observables, we have carried out calculations using a variety of strategies for analyzing the SNO and other experimental data.},

abstract = {First measurements of the mass and width of the Z0 performed at the newly commissioned LEP Collider by the DELPHI Collaboration are presented. The measuements are derived from the study of multihadronic final states produced in e+e− annihilations at several energies around the Z0 mass. The values found for the mass and width are M(Z0)=91.06±0.09 (stat) ±0.045 (syst.) GeV and $\Gamma$(Z0)=2.42±0.21 (stat.) GeV respectively, froma three-parameter fit to the line shape. A two-parameter fit in the framework of the standard model yields for the number of light neutrino species N$\nu$=2.4±0.4 (stat.) ±0.5 (syst.).},

abstract = {We propose the Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) detector as a next generation un- derground water Cherenkov detector. It will serve as a far detector of a long base- line neutrino oscillation experiment envisioned for the upgraded J-PARC beam, and as a detector capable of observing, far beyond the sensitivity of the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detector, proton decays, atmospheric neutrinos, and neutrinos from astro- physical origins. The current baseline design of Hyper-K is based on the highly suc- cessful Super-K detector, taking full advantage of a well-proven technology. Hyper-K consists of two cylindrical tanks lying side-by-side, the outer dimensions of each tank being 48(W) x54(H) x 250(L) m3. The total (fiducial) mass of the detector is 0.99 (0.56) million metric tons, which is about 20 (25) times larger than that of Super-K.   This set of three one- page whitepapers prepared for the US Snowmass process describes the opportunities for future physics discoveries at the Hyper-K facility with beam, atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos.},

abstract = {We have constructed and operated the ICARUS T600 liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC). The ICARUS T600 detector is the largest LAr TPC ever built, with a size of about 500 tons of fully imaging mass. The design and assembly of the detector relied on industrial support and represents the applications of concepts matured in laboratory tests to the kton scale. The ICARUS T600 was commissioned for a technical run that lasted about 3 months. During this period all the detector features were extensively tested with an exposure to cosmic-rays at surface with a resulting data collection of about 30000 events. The detector was developed as the first element of a modular design. Thanks to the concept of modularity, it will be possible to realize a detector with several ktons active mass, to act as an observatory for astroparticle and neutrino physics at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory and a second-generation nucleon decay experiment. In this paper a description of the ICARUS T600 is given, detailing its design specifications, assembly procedures and acceptance tests. Commissioning procedures and results of the technical run are also reported, as well as results from the off-line event reconstruction. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The characterisation of the system is described in detail. The reliability of such a camera system has been demonstrated over several months, and recent data from operation within the liquid argon region of the DUNE 35 t cryostat is presented. The cameras were used to monitor for high voltage breakdown inside the cryostat, with capability to observe breakdown of a liquid argon time projection chamber in situ. They were also used for detector monitoring, especially of components during cooldown.},

@article{LBNECollaboration2013,
abstract = {The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early Universe, the dynamics of the supernova bursts that produced the heavy elements necessary for life and whether protons eventually decay --- these mysteries at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution of our Universe, its current state and its eventual fate. The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developed plan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNE is conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensity neutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream of the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed as a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source at Fermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrino charge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yet cost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and can accommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptional combination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, and potential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facility for the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from around the globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year program of exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview of LBNE's scientific objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physics worldwide, the technologies it will incorporate and the capabilities it will possess.},

abstract = {\{GENIE\} [1] is a new neutrino event generator for the experimental neutrino physics community. The goal of the project is to develop a ‘canonical' neutrino interaction physics Monte Carlo whose validity extends to all nuclear targets and neutrino flavors from MeV to PeV energy scales. Currently, emphasis is on the few-GeV energy range, the challenging boundary between the non-perturbative and perturbative regimes, which is relevant for the current and near future long-baseline precision neutrino experiments using accelerator-made beams. The design of the package addresses many challenges unique to neutrino simulations and supports the full life-cycle of simulation and generator-related analysis tasks. \{GENIE\} is a large-scale software system, consisting of ∼ 120 000 lines of C ++ code, featuring a modern object-oriented design and extensively validated physics content. The first official physics release of \{GENIE\} was made available in August 2007, and at the time of the writing of this article, the latest available version was v2.4.4.},

The CHIPS detector (CHerenkov detector In Mine PitS) will be deployed in a flooded mine pit, removing the necessity and expense of a substantial external structure capable of supporting a large detector mass. There are a number of mine pits in northern Minnesota along the NuMI beam that could be used to deploy such a detector. In particular, the Wentworth Pit 2W is at the ideal off-axis angle to contribute to the measurement of the CP violating phase. The detector is designed so that it can be moved to a mine pit in the LBNE beam line once that becomes operational.},

abstract = {We perform a combined fit to global neutrino oscillation data available as of fall 2016 in the scenario of three-neutrino oscillations and present updated allowed ranges of the six oscillation parameters. We discuss the differences arising between the consistent combination of the data samples from accelerator and reactor experiments compared to partial combinations. We quantify the confidence in the determination of the less precisely known parameters $\theta$ 23, $\delta$ CP, and the neutrino mass ordering by performing a Monte Carlo study of the long baseline accelerator and reactor data. We find that the sensitivity to the mass ordering and the $\theta$ 23 octant is below 1$\sigma$. Maximal $\theta$ 23 mixing is allowed at slightly more than 90{\%} CL. The best fit for the CP violating phase is around 270{\textdegree}, CP conservation is allowed at slightly above 1$\sigma$, and values of $\delta$ CP ≃ 90{\textdegree} are disfavored at around 99{\%} CL for normal ordering and higher CL for inverted ordering.},

The target consists of 30.3 t of gallium in the form of 8.13 M aqueous gallium chloride solution (101 t), shielded by ≈ 3300 m water equivalent of standard rock in the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory (Italy). In nearly one year of operation, 14 measurements of the production rate of 71Ge were carried out to give, after corrections for side reactions and other backgrounds, an average value of 83 + 19 (stat.) ± 8 (syst.) SNU (1$\sigma$) due to solar neutrinos. This conclusion constitutes the first observation of solar pp neutrinos. Our result is consistent with the presence of the full pp neutrino flux expected according to the "standard solar model" together with a reduced flux of 8B + 7Be neutrinos as observed in the Homestake and Kamiokande experiments. Astrophysical reasons remain as a possible explanation of the solar neutrino problem. On the other hand, if the result is to be interpreted in terms of the MSW effect, it would fix neutrino masses and mixing angles within a very restricted range. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The low-noise operation of readout electronics in a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) is critical to properly extract the distribution of ionization charge deposited on the wire planes of the TPC, especially for the induction planes. This paper describes the characteristics and mitigation of the observed noise in the MicroBooNE detector. The MicroBooNE's single-phase LArTPC comprises two induction planes and one collection sense wire plane with a total of 8256 wires. Current induced on each TPC wire is amplified and shaped by custom low-power, low-noise ASICs immersed in the liquid argon. The digitization of the signal waveform occurs outside the cryostat. Using data from the first year of MicroBooNE operations, several excess noise sources in the TPC were identified and mitigated. The residual equivalent noise charge (ENC) after noise filtering varies with wire length and is found to be below 400 electrons for the longest wires (4.7 m). The response is consistent with the cold electronics design expectations and is found to be stable with time and uniform over the functioning channels. This noise level is significantly lower than previous experiments utilizing warm front-end electronics.},

We report on the analysis of events from cosmic rays and from radioactive sources collected from June 1991 to June 1993. We have systematically investigated the performance and the physical parameters of the detector. We present here the results obtained from the analysis of the cosmic rays data on the following items: the electron drift velocity, the electron lifetime, the free electron yield, the electron diffusion coefficient, the space resolution and the particle identification capability. The data from radioactive sources are used to study the energy resolution in the MeV range. The in depth understanding of the basic physics aspects of the liquid argon TPC allows us to conclude that such a detector can be built in large sizes and reliably operated over long periods of the time, providing a new instrument for physics experiments.},

The Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) has designed and fabricated a membrane cryostat prototype in collaboration with Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (IHI). LBNE has designed and fabricated the supporting cryogenic system infrastructure and successfully commissioned and operated the first membrane cryostat. Original goals of the prototype are: to demonstrate the membrane cryostat technology in terms of thermal performance, feasibility for liquid argon and leak tightness; to demonstrate that we can remove all the impurities from the vessel and achieve the purity requirements in a membrane cryostat without evacuation; to demonstrate that we can achieve and maintain the purity requirements of the liquid argon using mol sieve and copper filters. The purity requirements of a large liquid argon detector such as LBNE are contaminants below 200 parts per trillion (ppt) oxygen equivalent. LBNE is planning the design and construction of a large liquid argon detector. This presentation will present requirements, design and construction of the LBNE 35 ton membrane cryostat prototype, and detail the commissioning and performance. The experience and results of this prototype are extremely important for the development of the LBNE detector.},

abstract = {We report a measurement of the flux-averaged neutral-current elastic differential cross section for neutrinos scattering on mineral oil (CH2) as a function of four-momentum transferred squared, Q2. It is obtained by measuring the kinematics of recoiling nucleons with kinetic energy greater than 50 MeV which are readily detected in MiniBooNE. This differential cross-section distribution is fit with fixed nucleon form factors apart from an axial mass MA that provides a best fit for MA=1.39±0.11  GeV. Using the data from the charged-current neutrino interaction sample, a ratio of neutral-current to charged-current quasielastic cross sections as a function of Q2 has been measured. Additionally, single protons with kinetic energies above 350 MeV can be distinguished from neutrons and multiple nucleon events. Using this marker, the strange quark contribution to the neutral-current axial vector form factor at Q2=0, $\Delta$s, is found to be $\Delta$s=0.08±0.26.},

abstract = {The CRY software library generates correlated cosmic-ray particle shower distributions at one of three elevations (sea level, 2100 m, and 11300 m) for use as input to transport and detector simulation codes. Our simulation is based on precomputed input tables derived from full MCNPX simulations of primary cosmic rays on the atmosphere and benchmarked against published cosmic-ray measurements. Our simulation provides all particle production (muons, neutrons, protons, electrons, photons, and pions) with the proper flux within a user-specified area and altitude. The code generates individual showers of secondary particles sampling the energy, time of arrival, zenith angle, and multiplicity with basic correlations, and has user controls for latitude (geomagnetic cutoff) and solar cycle effects. We provide a function library, callable from C, C++, and Fortran, and interfaces to popular Monte Carlo transport codes (MCNP, MCNPX, COG, Geant4). The software library and examples can be downloaded from http://nuclear.llnl.gov/simulation.},

abstract = {The next generation neutrino observatory proposed by the LBNO collaboration will address fundamental questions in particle and astroparticle physics. The experiment consists of a far detector, in its first stage a 20 kt LAr double phase TPC and a magnetised iron calorimeter, situated at 2300 km from CERN and a near detector based on a high-pressure argon gas TPC. The long baseline provides a unique opportunity to study neutrino flavour oscillations over their 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima exploring the $L/E$ behaviour, and distinguishing effects arising from $\delta_{CP}$ and matter.   In this paper we have reevaluated the physics potential of this setup for determining the mass hierarchy (MH) and discovering CP-violation (CPV), using a conventional neutrino beam from the CERN SPS with a power of 750 kW. We use conservative assumptions on the knowledge of oscillation parameter priors and systematic uncertainties. The impact of each systematic error and the precision of oscillation prior is shown. We demonstrate that the first stage of LBNO can determine unambiguously the MH to $>5\sigma$C.L. over the whole phase space. We show that the statistical treatment of the experiment is of very high importance, resulting in the conclusion that LBNO has $\sim$ 100% probability to determine the MH in at most 4-5 years of running. Since the knowledge of MH is indispensable to extract $\delta_{CP}$ from the data, the first LBNO phase can convincingly give evidence for CPV on the $3\sigma$C.L. using today's knowledge on oscillation parameters and realistic assumptions on the systematic uncertainties.},

abstract = {The SLAC RCE platform is a general purpose clustered data acquisition system implemented on a custom ATCA compliant blade, called the Cluster On Board (COB). The core of the system is the Reconfigurable Cluster Element (RCE), which is a system-on-chip design based upon the Xilinx Zynq family of FPGAs, mounted on custom COB daughter-boards. The Zynq architecture couples a dual core ARM Cortex A9 based processor with a high performance 28nm FPGA. The RCE has 12 external general purpose bi-directional high speed links, each supporting serial rates of up to 12Gbps. 8 RCE nodes are included on a COB, each with a 10Gbps connection to an on-board 24-port Ethernet switch integrated circuit. The COB is designed to be used with a standard full-mesh ATCA backplane allowing multiple RCE nodes to be tightly interconnected with minimal interconnect latency. Multiple shelves can be clustered using the front panel 10-gbps connections. The COB also supports local and inter-blade timing and trigger distribution. An experiment specific Rear Transition Module adapts the 96 high speed serial links to specific experiments and allows an experiment-specific timing and busy feedback connection. This coupling of processors with a high performance FPGA fabric in a low latency, multiple node cluster allows high speed data processing that can be easily adapted to any physics experiment. RTEMS as well as Linux are ported to the module. The RCE has been used or is the baseline for several current and proposed experiments (LCLS, HPS, LSST, ATLAS-CSC, LBNE, DarkSide, ILC-SiD, etc).},

The transit time of the electrons from the emitting surface to a collecting plate depends on the applied electric field and ranges from a few tens of microseconds to milliseconds. The measurement of the purity is based on the ratio of collected to emitted charges. The operation can be performed in a few minutes and gives values of the electron lifetime with a typical error of a few percent. Filling and emptying the vessel can be done in less than an hour.},

abstract = {The discovery of leptonic CP violation is one of the primary goals of next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments, which is feasible due to the recent measurement of a relatively large leptonic mixing angle \theta_{13}. We suggest two new working observables \Delta A^{\rm m}_{\alpha \beta} \equiv \max[A^{\rm CP}_{\alpha \beta}(\delta)] - \min[A^{\rm CP}_{\alpha \beta}(\delta)] and \Delta A^{\rm CP}_{\alpha \beta}(\delta) \equiv A^{\rm CP}_{\alpha \beta}(\delta) - A^{\rm CP}_{\alpha \beta}(0) to describe the CP-violating effects in long-baseline and atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments. The former signifies the experimental sensitivity to the leptonic Dirac CP-violating phase $\delta$ and can be used to optimize the experimental setup, while the latter measures the intrinsic leptonic CP violation and can be used to extract $\delta$ directly from the experimental observations. Both analytical and numerical analyses are carried out to illustrate their main features. It turns out that an intense neutrino beam with sub-GeV energies and a baseline of a few 100 km may serve as an optimal experimental setup for probing leptonic CP violation.},

The search is performed in five decay modes: ????, ZZ, W +W -, ?? +?? -, and bb-. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, ???? and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3??0.4(stat.)??0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one. ?? 2012 CERN.},

abstract = {In recent investigations with the photographic method1,2, it has been shown that slow charged particles of small mass, present as a component of the cosmic radiation at high altitudes, can enter nuclei and produce disintegrations with the emission of heavy particles. It is convenient to apply the term ‘meson' to any particle with a mass intermediate between that of a proton and an electron. In continuing our experiments we have found evidence of mesons which, at the end of their range, produce secondary mesons. We have also observed transmutations in which slow mesons are ejected from disintegrating nuclei. Several features of these processes remain to be elucidated, but we present the following account of the experiments because the results appear to bear closely on the important problem of developing a satisfactory meson theory of nuclear forces.},

Data collected from the 1 st Run are being analyzed for both Physics studies and a technical characterization of the scintillation light collection system. Two analysis topics are reported: the method developed for charged pion cross section measurement, based on the specific features of the LArTPC, and the development and test of the LArIAT custom-designed cold front-end electronics for SiPM devices to collect LAr scintillation light.},

This corresponds to an electron lifetime in the range of several milliseconds equivalent to attenuation length of a few metres. The procedure has been tested up to flows of the order of 1000 litres of liquid per hour. The new technique makes it possible to operate very large amounts of ultrapure liquid argon as foreseen for the multikiloton ICARUS experiment at Gran Sasso.},

abstract = {The T2K experiment is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. Its main goal is to measure the last unknown lepton sector mixing angle {\theta}_{13} by observing {\nu}_e appearance in a {\nu}_{\mu} beam. It also aims to make a precision measurement of the known oscillation parameters, {\Delta}m^{2}_{23} and sin^{2} 2{\theta}_{23}, via {\nu}_{\mu} disappearance studies. Other goals of the experiment include various neutrino cross section measurements and sterile neutrino searches. The experiment uses an intense proton beam generated by the J-PARC accelerator in Tokai, Japan, and is composed of a neutrino beamline, a near detector complex (ND280), and a far detector (Super-Kamiokande) located 295 km away from J-PARC. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the instrumentation aspect of the T2K experiment and a summary of the vital information for each subsystem.},

abstract = {A study is made of neutrino energy reconstruction in the DUNE far detector. This detector will consist of four modules of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs), each with a fiducial mass of 10kt; the study uses simulations of one of these modules. We have developed a method to reconstruct the neutrino energy taking advantage of the excellent spatial and energy resolutions of LArTPCs. For events selected as numu CC interactions, the reconstructed energy is estimated as the sum of the momentum of the longest reconstructed track and the reconstructed hadronic energy. If the longest track is contained in the detector, its momentum is estimated from its range, while its momentum is estimated using multi-Coulomb scattering if it exits the detector. The hadronic energy is estimated using the charges of the reconstructed hits not in the track. For events selected as nue CC interactions, the reconstructed energy is estimated as the sum of the energy of the reconstructed shower with the highest total hit charge and the reconstructed hadronic energy. The hadronic energy is estimated from the charges of the reconstructed hits not in the shower. This method can be applied to other neutrino experiments that use the LArTPC technology.},

This chamber features a 2 m long drift distance. We measure the electron drift lifetime in the liquid argon using cosmic ray muons and the lifetime is at least 14 ms at 95% confidence level. LongBo is equipped with preamplifiers mounted on the detector in the liquid argon. Of the 144 channels, 128 channels were readout by preamplifiers made with discrete circuitry and 16 channels were readout by ASIC preamplifiers. For the discrete channels, we measure a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 30 at a drift field of 350 V/cm. The measured S/N ratio for the ASIC channels was 1.4 times larger than that measured for the discrete channels.},

abstract = {Several current and proposed experiments at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA, have novel data acquisition needs. These include 1) continuous digitization, using commercial high-speed digitizers, of signals from the detectors, 2) the transfer of all of the digitized waveform data to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processors, 3) the filtering or compression of the waveform data, or both, and 4) the writing of the resultant data to disk for later, more complete, analysis. To address these needs, members of the Accelerator and Detector Simulation and Support Department within the Scientific Computing Division at Fermilab are using parallel processing technologies in the development of artdaq, a generic data acquisition toolkit. The artdaq toolkit uses Message Passing Interface (MPI) and art, an established event-processing framework shared by new experiments at Fermilab. In an artdaq program, the digitized data are transferred into computing nodes using commodity Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) cards, and event fragments are transferred between distributed processes using MPI and assembled into complete events. These events are then processed by a configurable selection of user-specified algorithms, commonly including filtering and compression algorithms, using the art event-processing framework. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of the first phase of the artdaq toolkit and shows early performance results with configurations that match upcoming experiments both at Fermilab and elsewhere.},

abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0×10−21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1$\sigma$. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410+160−180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z=0.09+0.03−0.04. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36+5−4M⊙ and 29+4−4M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 62+4−4M⊙, with 3.0+0.5−0.5M⊙c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

abstract = {We report the results of first physics runs of the L3 detector at LEP. Based on 2538 hadron events, we determined the mass mz0 and the width $\Gamma$z0 of the intermediate vector boson Z0 to be mz0=91.132±0.057 GeV (not including the 46 MeV LEP machine energy uncertainty) and $\Gamma$z0=2.588±0.137 GeV. We also determined $\Gamma$invisible=0.567±0.080 GeV, corresponding to 3.42±0.48 number of neutrino flavors. We also measured the muon pair cross section and determined the branching ratio $\Gamma$$\mu$$\mu$=$\Gamma$h=0.056±0.006. The partial width of Z0→e+e− is $\Gamma$ee=88±9±7 MeV.},

@article{Bilenky2015,
abstract = {After discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN the Standard Model acquired a status of the theory of the elementary particles in the electroweak range (up to about 300 GeV). What general conclusions can be inferred from the Standard Model? It looks that the Standard Model teaches us that in the framework of such general principles as local gauge symmetry, unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions and Brout-Englert-Higgs spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry nature chooses the simplest possibilities. Two-component left-handed massless neutrino fields play crucial role in the determination of the charged current structure of the Standard Model. The absence of the right-handed neutrino fields in the Standard Model is the simplest, most economical possibility. In such a scenario Majorana mass term is the only possibility for neutrinos to be massive and mixed. Such mass term is generated by the lepton-number violating Weinberg effective Lagrangian. In this approach three Majorana neutrino masses are suppressed with respect to the masses of other fundamental fermions by the ratio of the electroweak scale and a scale of a lepton-number violating physics. The discovery of the neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay and absence of transitions of flavor neutrinos into sterile states would be evidence in favor of the minimal scenario we advocate here.},

abstract = {An experiment has been performed to test whether fission product antineutrinos will invert the electron capture decay of Ar37 37 by the reaction Cl37($\nu$¯,e−) 37 ( $\nu$ ¯ , e − ) Ar37 37 . Three thousand gallons of carbon tetrachloride were exposed to the high antineutrino flux from a production reactor at the Savannah River plant. The argon-37 was isolated and counted in a low level counter. The cross section for this process was found to be less than 0.25 x 10−45 − 45 cm2 2 , a factor of 20 below the cross section calculated assuming neutrino-antineutrino identity. The result is consistent with the principle of lepton conservation. Argon-37 was observed in the experiment produced by cosmic radiation and fast neutrons. The Ar37 37 observed in the experiment can be used to set an upper limit on the product of the solar neutrino flux and the average cross section for the neutrino capture reaction: ϕ$\sigma$¯<1.1×10−33 ϕ $\sigma$ ¯ < 1.1 × 10 − 33 disintegrations sec−1 − 1 .},

abstract = {The development of automated solutions to pattern recognition problems is important in many areas of scientific research and human endeavour. This paper describes the implementation of the Pandora software development kit, which aids the process of designing, implementing and running pattern recognition algorithms. The Pandora Application Programming Interfaces ensure simple specification of the building-blocks defining a pattern recognition problem. The logic required to solve the problem is implemented in algorithms. The algorithms request operations to create or modify data structures and the operations are performed by the Pandora framework. This design promotes an approach using many decoupled algorithms, each addressing specific topologies. Details of algorithms addressing two pattern recognition problems in High Energy Physics are presented: reconstruction of events at a high-energy {\$}{\$}e^{\{}+{\}}e^{\{}-{\}}{\$}{\$} e + e - linear collider and reconstruction of cosmic ray or neutrino events in a liquid argon time projection chamber.},

The algorithms studied include the classification of single particle images, the localization of single particle and neutrino interactions in an image, and the detection of a simulated neutrino event overlaid with cosmic ray backgrounds taken from real detector data. These studies demonstrate the potential of convolutional neural networks for particle identification or event detection on simulated neutrino interactions. We also address technical issues that arise when applying this technique to data from a large LArTPC at or near ground level.},

@article{Ohlsson2012,
abstract = {Since the smallest leptonic mixing angle theta_{13} has been measured to be relatively large, it is quite promising to constrain or determine the leptonic Dirac CP-violating phase delta in future neutrino oscillation experiments. Given some typical values of delta = pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2 at the low-energy scale, as well as current experimental results of the other neutrino parameters, we perform a systematic study of the radiative corrections to delta by using the one-loop renormalization group equations in the minimal supersymmetric standard model and the universal extra-dimensional model. It turns out that delta is rather stable against radiative corrections in both models, except for the minimal supersymmetric standard model with a very large value of tan beta. Both cases of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos are discussed. In addition, we use the preliminary indication of delta = (1.08^{+0.28}_{-0.31}) pi or delta = (1.67^{+0.37}_{-0.77}) pi from the latest global-fit analyses of data from neutrino oscillation experiments to illustrate how it will be modified by radiative corrections.},

abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb^-1 collected at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb^-1 at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H->ZZ^(*)->llll, H->gamma gamma and H->WW->e nu mu nu in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H->ZZ^(*), WW^(*), bbbar and tau^+tau^- in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H->ZZ^(*)->llll and H->gamma gamma channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0 +/- 0.4(stat) +/- 0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7x10^-9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.},

abstract = {We investigate the quantitative impact that data from the second oscillation maximum has on the performance of wide band beam neutrino oscillation experiments. We present results for the physics sensitivities to standard three flavor oscillation, as well as results for the sensitivity to non-standard interactions. The quantitative study is performed using an experimental setup similar to the Fermilab to DUSEL Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE). We find that, with the single exception of sensitivity to the mass hierarchy, the second maximum plays only a marginal role due to the experimental difficulties to obtain a statistically significant and sufficiently background-free event sample at low energies. This conclusion is valid for both water {{\v{C}}}erenkov and liquid argon detectors. Moreover, we confirm that non-standard neutrino interactions are very hard to distinguish experimentally from standard three-flavor effects and can lead to a considerable loss of sensitivity to $\theta$ 13, the mass hierarchy and CP violation.},

abstract = {The Liquid Argon Purity Demonstrator was an R&D test stand designed to determine if electron drift lifetimes adequate for large neutrino detectors could be achieved without first evacuating the cryostat. We describe here the cryogenic system, its operations, and the apparatus used to determine the contaminant levels in the argon and to measure the electron drift lifetime. The liquid purity obtained by this system was facilitated by a gaseous argon purge. Additionally, gaseous impurities from the ullage were prevented from entering the liquid at the gas-liquid interface by condensing the gas and filtering the resulting liquid before returning to the cryostat. The measured electron drift lifetime in this test was greater than 6 ms, sustained over several periods of many weeks. Measurements of the temperature profile in the argon, to assess convective flow and boiling, were also made and are compared to simulation.},

abstract = {New data from the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment produce the most precise measurement of the neutrino mixing parameter theta_{23}. Using an off-axis neutrino beam with a peak energy of 0.6 GeV and a data set corresponding to 6.57 x 10^{20} protons on target, T2K has fit the energy-dependent nu_mu oscillation probability to determine oscillation parameters. Marginalizing over the values of other oscillation parameters yields sin^2 (theta_{23}) = 0.514 +0.055/-0.056 (0.511 +- 0.055), assuming normal (inverted) mass hierarchy. The best-fit mass-squared splitting for normal hierarchy is Delta m^2_{32} = 2.51 +- 0.10 x 10^{-3} eV^2/c^4 (inverted hierarchy: Delta m^2_{13} = 2.48 +- 0.10 x 10^{-3} eV^2/c^4). Adding a model of multinucleon interactions that affect neutrino energy reconstruction is found to produce only small biases in neutrino oscillation parameter extraction at current levels of statistical uncertainty.},

The proposed apparatus employ three different and, to some extent, complementary detection techniques: GLACIER (liquid Argon TPC), LENA (liquid scintillator) and MEMPHYS (\WC), based on the use of large mass of liquids as active detection media. The results of these studies are presented along with a critical discussion of the performance attainable by the three proposed approaches coupled to existing or planned underground laboratories, in relation to open and outstanding physics issues such as the search for matter instability, the detection of astrophysical- and geo-neutrinos and to the possible use of these detectors in future high-intensity neutrino beams.},

abstract = {We point out that the recent data from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, together with other relevant measurements from solar and reactor neutrino experiments, convincingly show that the flavor transitions of solar neutrinos are affected by Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effects. More precisely, one can safely reject the null hypothesis of no MSW interaction energy in matter, despite the fact that the interaction amplitude (formally treated as a free parameter) is still weakly constrained by the current phenomenology. Such a constraint can be improved, however, by future data from the KamLAND experiment. In the standard MSW case, we also perform an updated analysis of two-family active oscillations of solar and reactor neutrinos.},

We find that using the updated non-zero value of $G_E^n$ has a significant effect on both the total and differential neutrino and antineutrino quasielastic cross sections. Previous extractions of the weak axial form factor from neutrino scattering data are sensitive to the assumptions that were used for the vector form factors.

abstract = {This Letter reports a measurement of the flux and energy spectrum of electron antineutrinos from six 2.9$\sim$GW$_{th}$ nuclear reactors with six detectors deployed in two near (effective baselines 512$\sim$m and 561$\sim$m) and one far (1,579$\sim$m) underground experimental halls in the Daya Bay experiment. Using 217 days of data, 296,721 and 41,589 inverse beta decay (IBD) candidates were detected in the near and far halls, respectively. The measured IBD yield is (1.55 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-18}$$\sim$cm$^2$/GW/day or (5.92 $\pm$ 0.14) $\times$ 10$^{-43}$$\sim$cm$^2$/fission. This flux measurement is consistent with previous short-baseline reactor antineutrino experiments and is $0.946\pm0.022$ ($0.991\pm0.023$) relative to the flux predicted with the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) fissile antineutrino model. The measured IBD positron energy spectrum deviates from both spectral predictions by more than 2$\sigma$ over the full energy range with a local significance of up to $\sim$4$\sigma$ between 4-6 MeV. A reactor antineutrino spectrum of IBD reactions is extracted from the measured positron energy spectrum for model-independent predictions.},

abstract = {The LBNE Project is developing a design for multiple 20 kiloton liquid argon (LAr) time projection chambers to be used as the far detector for the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment. An essential component of this design is a complete electronic readout system designed to operate in LAr (at 90K). This system is being implemented as a CMOS ASIC, in 180nm commercial technology, that will provide low-noise readout of the signals induced on the TPC wires, digitization of those signals at 2 MS/s, zero-suppression, buffering and output multiplexing to a small number of cryostat feed-throughs. A resolution better than 1000 rms electrons at 200 pF input capacitance for an input range of 300 fC is required, along with low power (<15mW/channel) and operation in LAr with a lifetime greater than 15 years. An analog-only frontend has been successfully completed and fully evaluated, and will be used in the MicroBooNE LAr TPC. A prototype of the digital section has been fabricated and is being evaluated. The results demonstrate that CMOS transistors have lower noise and much improved dc characteristics at LAr temperature. We will describe the progress to date and plans for the remaining development.},

We compare the results from the new models with the predictions of a series of models that use OPAL radiative opacities, older determinations of the surface heavyelement abundances, and refinements of nuclear reaction rates. For all the variations we consider, solar models that are constructed with the newer and lower heavy-element abundances advocated by Asplund et al. disagree by much more than the estimated measuring errors with the helioseismological determinations of the depth of the solar convective zone, the surface helium composition, the internal sound speeds, and the density profile. Using the new OP radiative opacities, the ratio of the 8\nB neutrino flux calculated with the older and larger heavyelement abundances (or with the newer and lower heavy-element abundances) to the total neutrino flux measured by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is 1.09 (0.87) with a 9% experimental uncertainty and a 16% theoretical uncertainty, 1 j errors.},

After recollecting the birth of modern neutrino physics with nonzero masses and flavor mixing, I summarize the present status of measurement of the mixing parameters in 2-3, 1-2, and 1-3 sectors of the MNS matrix. Then, I describe the attempts to uncover the regularities, if any, in the measured values of the mixing angles; mostly reviewing. Yet, a possible large deviation of \theta_{23} to the second octant may trigger interests in the triangle relation of the lepton mixing angles. In the latter part of my lecture some perspective of determination of the mass hierarchy and measurement of lepton Kobayashi-Maskawa phase $\delta$ are described. Finally, I discuss the prospects of the new, fast developing field of high-energy neutrino astrophysics, and the emerging new precision era of cosmology and particle physics. I conclude with optimistic speculations.},

@article{Renshaw2014,
abstract = {Super-Kamiokande-IV (SK-IV) data taking began in September of 2008, after upgrading the electronics and data acquisition system. Due to these upgrades and improvements to water system dynamics, calibration and analysis techniques, a solar neutrino signal could be extracted at recoil electron kinetic energies as low as 3.5 MeV. When the SK-IV data is combined with the previous three SK phases, the SK extracted solar neutrino flux is found to be $[2.37\pm0.015\mbox{(stat.)}\pm0.04\mbox{(syst.)}]\times10^6$/(cm$^{2}$sec). The combination of the SK recoil electron energy spectra slightly favors distortions due to a changing electron flavor content. Such distortions are predicted when assuming standard solar neutrino oscillation solutions. An extended maximum likelihood fit to the amplitude of the expected solar zenith angle variation of the neutrino-electron elastic scattering rate results in a day-night asymmetry of $[-3.2\pm1.1$(stat.)$\pm0.5$(syst.)]$\%$. A solar neutrino global oscillation analysis including all current solar neutrino data, as well as KamLAND reactor antineutrino data, measures the solar mixing angle as $\sin^2\theta_{12}=0.305\pm0.013$, the solar neutrino mass squared splitting as $\Delta m^2_{21}=7.49^{+0.19}_{-0.17}\times10^{-5}$eV$^2$ and $\sin^2\theta_{13}=0.026^{+0.017}_{-0.012}$.},

We provide the allowed ranges of the six oscillation parameters and show that their determination is stable with respect to uncertainties related to reactor neutrino and solar neutrino flux predictions. We find that the maximal possible value of the Jarlskog invariant in the lepton sector is 0.033 {\textpm}0.010 ({\textpm}0.027) at the 1$\sigma$ (3$\sigma$) level and we use leptonic unitarity triangles to illustrate the ability of global oscillation data to obtain information on CP violation. We discuss ``tendencies and tensions'' of the global fit related to the octant of $\theta$ 23 as well as the CP violating phase $\delta$ CP. The favored values of $\delta$ CP are around 3$\pi$/2 while values around $\pi$/2 are disfavored at about $\Delta$$\chi$2 ≃6. We comment on the non-trivial task to assign a confidence level to this $\Delta$$\chi$ 2 value by performing a Monte Carlo study of T2K data.},

abstract = {Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin.},

abstract = {We discuss the ICARUS T600 detector capabilities in electromagnetic shower reconstruction through the analysis of a sample of 212 events, coming from the 2001 Pavia surface test run, of hadronic interactions leading to the production of pi^0 mesons. Methods of shower energy and shower direction measurements were developed and the invariant mass of the photon pairs was reconstructed. The (gamma,gamma) invariant mass was found to be consistent with the value of the pi^0 mass. The resolution of the reconstructed pi^0 mass was found to be equal to 27.3%. An improved analysis, carried out in order to clean the full event sample from the events measured in the crowded environment, mostly due to the trigger conditions, gave a pi^0 mass resolution of 16.1%, significantly better than the one evaluated for the full event sample. The trigger requirement of the coincidence of at least four photomultiplier signals favored the selection of events with a strong pile up of cosmic ray tracks and interactions. Hence a number of candidate pi^0 events were heavily contaminated by other tracks and had to be rejected. Monte Carlo simulations of events with pi^0 production in hadronic and neutrino interactions confirmed the validity of the shower energy and shower direction reconstruction methods applied to the real data.},

abstract = {Recent work in astrophysics has show that most of the matter in the universe is non-luminous. This work investigates two searches for non-luminous matter: hot dark matter formed from cosmic relic neutrinos from the Big Bang, and directional detection of cold dark matter. The cosmic neutrino background is investigated through the KATRIN experiment, using neutrino capture on tritium to search for a signal. A sensitivity at KATRIN of about 10⁴ events per year, or a local overdensity of relic neutrinos of about 3 x 10⁹ is found. Directional detection of cold dark matter provides a unique way to distinguish a dark matter signal from terrestrial backgrounds, using the expected direction of a dark matter wind based on astrophysical parameters. This work presents a new technique for directional dark matter detection--a drift chamber readout using a CCD camera. The backgrounds of this detector are investigated and enumerated, and a dark matter search sets a limit at mX =100 GeV of 3.7 x 10³³ cm².},

abstract = {We perform a comparison of the different future neutrino oscillation experiments based on the achievable precision in the determination of the fundamental parameters theta_{13} and the CP phase, delta, assuming that theta_{13} is in the range indicated by the recent Daya Bay measurement. We study the non-trivial dependence of the error on delta on its true value. When matter effects are small, the largest error is found at the points where CP violation is maximal, and the smallest at the CP conserving points. The situation is different when matter effects are sizable. As a result of this effect, the comparison of the physics reach of different experiments on the basis of the CP discovery potential, as usually done, can be misleading. We have compared various proposed super-beam, beta-beam and neutrino factory setups on the basis of the relative precision of theta_{13} and the error on delta. Neutrino factories, both high-energy or low-energy, outperform alternative beam technologies. An ultimate precision on theta_{13} below 3% and an error on delta of < 7^{\circ} at 1 sigma (1 d.o.f.) can be obtained at a neutrino factory.},

abstract = {We report on the final electroweak measurements performed with data taken at the Z resonance by the experiments operating at the electron-positron colliders SLC and LEP. The data consist of 17 million Z decays accumulated by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments at LEP, and 600 thousand Z decays by the SLD experiment using a polarised beam at SLC. The measurements include cross-sections, forward-backward asymmetries and polarised asymmetries. The mass and width of the Z boson, mZZ, and ??Z, its couplings to fermions, for example the ?? parameter and the efffective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, are precisely measured: mZ= 91.1875 ?? 0.0021 GeV, ??Z= 2.4952 ?? 0.0023 GeV, ?????= 1.0050 ?? 0.0010, sin2??efflept= 0.23153 ?? 0.00016. The number of light neutrino species is determined to be 2.9840 ?? 0.0082, in agreement with the three observed generations of fundamental fermions. The results are compared to the predictions of the Standard Model (SM). At the Z-pole, electroweak radiative corrections beyond the running of the QED and QCD coupling constants are observed with a significance of five standard deviations, and in agreement with the Standard Model. Of the many Z-pole measurements, the forward-backward asymmetry in b-quark production shows the largest difference with respect to its SM expectation, at the level of 2.8 standard deviations. Through radiative corrections evaluated in the framework of the Standard Model, the Z-pole data are also used to predict the mass of the top quark, mt= 173-10+13GeV, and the mass of the W boson, mW= 80.363 ?? 0.032 GeV. These indirect constraints are compared to the direct measurements, providing a stringent test of the SM. Using in addition the direct measurements of mtand mW, the mass of the as yet unobserved SM Higgs boson is predicted with a relative uncertainty of about 50% and found to be less than 285 GeV at 95% confidence level. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A review of accelerator long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments is provided, including all experiments performed to date and the projected sensitivity of those currently in progress. Accelerator experiments have played a crucial role in the confirmation of the neutrino oscillation phenomenon and in precision measurements of the parameters. With a fixed baseline and detectors providing good energy resolution, precise measurements of the ratio of distance/energy (L/E) on the scale of individual events have been made and the expected oscillatory pattern resolved. Evidence for electron neutrino appearance has recently been obtained, opening a door for determining the CP violating phase as well as resolving the mass hierarchy and the octant of theta23: some of the last unknown parameters of the standard model extended to include neutrino mass.},

abstract = {We present a front-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for a wire based time-projection-chamber (TPC) operating in liquid Argon (LAr). The LAr TPC will be used for long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The ASIC must provide a low-noise readout of the signals induced on the TPC wires, digitization of those signals at 2 MSamples/s, compression, buffering and multiplexing. A resolution of better than 1000 rms electrons at 200 pF input capacitance for an input range of 300 fC is required, along with low power and operation in LAr (at 87 K). We include the characterization of a commercial technology for operation in the cryogenic environment and the first experimental results on the analog front end. The results demonstrate that complementary metal-oxide semiconductor transistors have lower noise and much improved dc characteristics at LAr temperature. Finally, we introduce the concept of “1/f equivalent” to model the low-frequency component of the noise spectral density, for use in the input metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor optimization.},

@article{ECalJINST,
abstract = {The T2K experiment studies oscillations of an off-axis muon neutrino beam between the J-PARC accelerator complex and the Super-Kamiokande detector. Special emphasis is placed on measuring the mixing angle theta_13 by observing electron neutrino appearance via the sub-dominant muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillation, and searching for CP violation in the lepton sector. The experiment includes a sophisticated, off-axis, near detector, the ND280, situated 280 m downstream of the neutrino production target in order to measure the properties of the neutrino beam and to understand better neutrino interactions at the energy scale below a few GeV. The data collected with the ND280 are used to study charged- and neutral-current neutrino interaction rates and kinematics prior to oscillation, in order to reduce uncertainties in the oscillation measurements by the far detector. A key element of the near detector is the ND280 electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal), consisting of active scintillator bars sandwiched between lead sheets and read outwith multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs). The ECal is vital to the reconstruction of neutral particles, and the identification of charged particle species. The ECal surrounds the Pi-0 detector (P0D) and the tracking region of the ND280, and is enclosed in the former UA1/NOMAD dipole magnet. This paper describes the design, construction and assembly of the ECal, as well as the materials from which it is composed. The electronic and data acquisition (DAQ) systems are discussed, and performance of the ECal modules, as deduced from measurements with particle beams, cosmic rays, the calibration system, and T2K data, is described.},

The workshop was organized under the auspices of the Coordinating Panel for Advanced Detectors, a body that was initiated by the American Physical Society Division of Particles and Fields. All presentations at the workshop were made in seven topical plenary sessions: i ) Argon Purity, ii ) Cryogenics, iii ) TPC and High Voltage, iv ) Electronics, Data Acquisition and Triggering, v ) Scintillation Light Detection, vi ) Calibration and Test Beams, and vii ) Software. This document summarizes the current efforts in each of these areas. It also highlights areas in LArTPC research and development that are common between neutrino experiments and dark matter experiments.},

At small mixing angles in vacuum the enhancement is resonant with respect to the neutrino energies or matter density. In a wide range of the oscillation parameters $\Delta$m2=(10-4-10-8) eV2 and sin2 2THETA > 10-4 the resonance effect is essential for solar neutrinos. The effect leads to strong suppression of the neutrino flux even at small sin2 2THETA},
